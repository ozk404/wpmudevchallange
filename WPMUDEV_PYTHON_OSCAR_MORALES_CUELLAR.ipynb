        "1. **What is the difference between Query and Scan operations in DynamoDB?**  \n",
        "a **Query** operation is more eficient because it retrieves items based on the primary key (PK) using an indexed lookup, query only scans the relevant partition, making it faster and cost effective, a **Scan** operation reads the entire table sequentially, which can be intensive and slow, especially for large and big datasets, we typically use scan only when you cannot filter items using indexed keys.  \n",

        "2. **What are projection expressions in DynamoDB?**  \n",
        "Projection Expression allows you to specify the attributes you want to retrieve when performing a query or a scan, this helps minimize the amount of data returned.\n",

        "You can enable Time to Live (TTL) in a DynamoDB table, similar to how TTL works in MongoDB. You designate a specific attribute (e.g., expiresAt) to store a timestamp in Unix epoch format. DynamoDB automatically deletes items when this timestamp is reached, making it ideal for managing temporary data like sessions or cache record.\n"
